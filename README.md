# Real-time Sports Scores in Home Assistant

This integration provides real-time scores for teams and athletes in multiple professional (NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, MLS, and more), college (NCAA), and international (soccer, golf, tennis, racing, cricket) sports using the ESPN Scoreboard APIs, and creates a sensor with detailed data for the competition. Services exist to change and interact with the sensor.

This integration can be used with the [ha-teamtracker-card](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker-card) to display the game information in the Home Assistant dashboard.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker/wiki) for FAQs, troubleshooting advise, and custom API configurations that have been already been validated.  Please contribute to help others.

This integration is a fork of the excellent [ha-nfl](https://github.com/zacs/ha-nfl) custom component by @zacs.  Thanks for the starting place!

#### Version Compatibility
 - Releases for [ha-teamtracker](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker) and [ha-teamtracker-card](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker-card) follow the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH convention.
 - All teamtracker and teamtracker-card releases with the same MAJOR and MINOR version numbers will be compatible, regardless of PATCH version.
 - For example, any teamtracker v0.2.x will be compatible with any teamtracker-card v0.2.y.
 - Compatibility is not guaranteed across different MAJOR or MINOR version numbers.

## Supported Teams and Leagues
TeamTracker will work for any of the hundreds of teams/leagues for which an ESPN scoreboard API exists.  

A small subset of the most popular teams/leagues have been pre-configured to simplify their setup.  This is referred to as native support.  Unfortunately, given the large number of teams/leagues for which APIs exist, it is impossible to provide native support for all of them.  

The remaining teams/leagues are still supported, however they require a couple extra steps to set up.  This is referred to as configuring a Custom API.

### Natively Supported (Pre-Configured) Sports / Leagues

The following leagues are supported natively:
- Australian Football - AFL
- Baseball - MLB
- Basketball - NBA, WNBA, NCAAM, NCAAW, WNBA
- Football - NFL, NCAAF, XFL
- Golf - PGA
- Hockey - NHL
- MMA - UFC
- U.S. Soccer - MLS, NWSL
- International Soccer - BUND (German Bundesliga), CL (Champions League), CLA (Conmebol Libertadores), EPL (English Premiere League), LIGA (Spanish LaLiga), LIG1 (French Ligue 1), SERA (Italian Serie A), WC (World Cup), WWC (Women's World Cup)
- Racing - F1, IRL
- Tennis - ATP, WTA
- Volleyball - NCAAVB, NCAAVBW

### Sports / Leagues Supported by Configuring a Custom API

It is possible to configure Team Tracker to use any existing ESPN Scoreboard API, not just the pre-configured leagues.  This is done by configuring a Custom API. 

Sensors with Custom APIs require more steps to set up, however once set up, they behave the same as a natively supported sensor.  There is no difference between a team playing in a natively supported soccer league or a non-natively supported soccer league other than the extra steps needed to initially set up the non-natively supported one.

The [Custom APIs](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-apis--how-to-determine-the-sport-path-and-league-path-sport_path-league_path) section below provides more details for setting up Custom API Configurations.

| api_language | None | No | Overrides default API language | [ISO language code](https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/) |
| conference_id | Conference Number | Only if `league_id` is an NCAA football or basketball | Conference ID  | [See below](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker?tab=readme-ov-file#specify-the-conference---for-ncaa-sports-only-conference_id) |
| sport_path | Sport Path | If `league_id` is `XXX` | Sport Path for Custom API | [See below](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-apis--how-to-determine-the-sport-path-and-league-path-sport_path-league_path) |
| league_path | League Path | If `league_id` is `XXX` | League Path for Custom | [See below](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-apis--how-to-determine-the-sport-path-and-league-path-sport_path-league_path) |


#### Specify the League (league_id)

The `league_id` configuration key is used the specify the league for the sensor.  The following values are valid:
- ATP (Assc. of Tennis Professionals)
- BUND (German Bundesliga)
- CL (Champions League)
- CLA (Conmebol Libertadores)
- EPL (English Premiere League)
- F1 (Formula 1 Racing)
- IRL (Indy Racing League)
- LIGA (Spanish LaLiga)
- LIG1 (French Ligue 1)
- MLB (Major League Baseball)
- MLS (Major League Soccer)
- NBA (National Basketball Assc.)
- NCAAF (NCAA Football)
- NCAAM (NCAA Men's Basketball)
- NCAAW (NCAA Women's Basketball)
- NCAAVB (NCAA Men's Volleyball)
- NCAAVBW (NCAA Women's Volleyball)
- NFL (National Football League)
- NWSL (National Women's Soccer League)
- PGA (Professional Golfers' Assc.)
- SERA (Italian Serie A)
- UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship)
- XFL (XFL)
- WC (World Cup)
- WNBA (Women's NBA)
- WTA (Women's Tennis Assc.)
- XXX (Custom: Specify Sport and League Path)

Using `XXX` or selecting "Custom: Specify Sport and League Path" from the UI enables the creation of a Custom API and requires the `sport_path` and `league_path` configuration keys to be defined.

#### Specify the Team (team_id)

The `team_id` configuration key is used the specifiy the competitor to track for the sensor.  It can take the form of a Team Abbreviation, Team ID, Athlete Name, Regular Expression, or the Wildcard character (`*`).

| Form | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Team Abbreviation | This is the 2-, 3- or 4-letter abbreviation (eg. "SEA" for Seattle or "NE" for New England) ESPN uses when space is limited.  You can generally find them at https://espn.com/ in the top scores UI, but they can also be found in other pages with team stats as well. |
| Team ID | ESPN assigns a unique number to identify a team.  This unique number shows up in URLs and other locations. |
| Athlete Name | For sports involving individual athletes, you should use the athlete's name as the search string.  You should use as much as is needed to uniquely identify the desired athlete. |
| RegEx | Regular expressions can be used to match team names, athlete names, and rosters in competitions like Doubles Tennis.  See below for an example. |
| Wildcard | You can use the single `*` character as a Wildcard.  This will cause the sensor to match a team or athlete using sport-specific logic outlined below. |

*RegEx*

For doubles in tennis, rosters are used instead of team names and are in the format of `{Player 1} / {Player 2}`.  You can use a regular expression to match the roster.  As an example, if you do not know the order in which the players are listed on the roster, the regular expression `.*(?:NADAL|ALCARAZ).*/.*(?:NADAL|ALCARAZ).*` will match a doubles match with Nadal and Alcaraz regardless of which player is listed first.  The names are not case sensitive.

*Wildcard*

The Wildcard behavior varies based on the sport.
| Sport | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Golf | Displays the current leader and competitor in second place |
| MMA | Displays the current active fight or the next upcoming fight if none are active |
| Racing | Displays the current leader and competitor in second place |
| Tennis | Results will be unpredictable due to multiple tournaments and matches in progress at once |
| Team Sports | Most useful for playoffs.  Will continually reset to display whatever team competition is in progress in the league.  Results will be unpredictable if multiple competitions are in progress at once |

#### Override the API Language (api_language)

NOTE:  Team Abbreviations and Names may vary based on your local language.  While rare, changing the language after a sensor is set up can cause it to stop working.

TeamTracker will use your local language settings when calling the ESPN APIs.  Some languages are supported more robustly than others.  For example, one language may provide play-by-play updates while another will not.  For this reason, you can override your local language.  English appears to be the most robustly supported language.

If you set up the sensor using the Home Assistant UI, you can add the override language code via the sensor's Configure button after it has been created.

If you are setting up the sensor using YAML.  You can add the `api_language` configuration key to your YAML configuration.

You should use a [standard ISO language code](https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/) when specifying an override.

#### Specify the Conference - for NCAA Sports only (conference_id)

The `conference_id` configuration key is used the specifiy the Conference for the sensor.  It should only be used for NCAA football and basketball.  Using it for other leagues or sports will cause a `NOT_FOUND` state.

By default, NCAA football and basketball will only find a game if at least one of the teams playing is ranked.  In order to find games in which both teams are unranked, you must specify a Conference ID, which is a number used by ESPN to identify college conferences and other groups of teams.  Conferences ID's are not consistent across football and basketball.

The following is a list of the college conferences and the corresponding number ESPN uses for their Conference ID.  For games involving at least one ranked team, no Conference ID is needed.

| Conference | Football Conf. ID | Basketball Conf. ID | Baseball Conf. ID | Softball Conf. ID
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ACC | 1 | 2 | 37 | 40 |
| American | 151 | 62 |  |  |

| FBS (1-A) | 80 |  | Subset of unranked FBS games |
| FCS (1-AA) | 81 |  | Subset of FCS games |
| DIVII/III | 35 |  | Subset of D2/D3 games |
| D1 |  | 50 | Subset of unranked D1 games |
| D1 |  | 100 | NCAA Tournament |

#### Custom APIs:  How to Determine the Sport Path and League Path (sport_path, league_path)

Setting the `league_id` configuration key to `XXX` or selecting "Custom: Specify Sport and League Path" from the UI, invokes the Custom API Configuration mode. 
 This requires you to set the `sport_path` and `league_path` configuration keys.  This section explains how to determine the correct values for these keys.

All ESPN APIs use a URL in the following format:
https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/{SPORT_PATH}/{LEAGUE_PATH}/scoreboard
where {SPORT_PATH} is the sport and {LEAGUE_PATH} is the league that the team plays in.

For example, for the NFL, the URL is https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard

The [Custom API Configuration section of the Wiki](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker/wiki/Custom-API-Configurations) contains more details on how to determine the {SPORT_PATH} and {LEAGUE_PATH} as well as some that have been verified to work and some that are known to not be compatible.  Please update the Wiki if you try others.

The [FAQ in the Wiki](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) also contains an explanation of the types of sports that work with the teamtracker integration and those that currently do not.

Once you have used the resources referenced above to determine the correct values to use for `sport_path` and `league_path`, you should use those values in the YAML or UI configuration.


### Configuration via the "Configuration->Integrations" section of the Home Assistant UI

1. On the Integrations page, select the "+ Add Integration" button.
2. Search for the integration labeled "Team Tracker" and select it.  
3. Select the desired League from the League List.  Select "Custom:  Specific sport and league path" to create a Custom API.
4. Enter a value for team's ID in the UI prompt. This can be a the team abbreviation, team ID, athlete name, wildcard, or a regex as explained in the [Team ID](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker?tab=readme-ov-file#specify-the-team-team_id) section.
5. If NCAA football or basketball, enter the Conference ID from [Conference ID](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker?tab=readme-ov-file#specify-the-conference---for-ncaa-sports-only-conference_id) section if desired.  
6. You can also enter a friendly name. If you keep the default, your sensor will be `sensor.team_tracker`, otherwise it will be `sensor.friendly_name_you_entered`.
7. If you are setting up a Custom API, a second window will be displayed.
8. Enter the value for the Sport Path for the Custom API.
9. Enter the value for the League Path for the Custom API.

Once the sensor is set up with the UI, you can use the Options Menu to override the API language if desired.

### Manual Configuration in your `configuration.yaml` file

To create a sensor via YAML, add the following configuration to your sensor definitions.  Enclose the values in quotes to avoid unrealized conflicts w/ predefined terms in YAML (i.e. NO being interpreted as No):

```
- platform: teamtracker
  league_id: "NFL"
  team_id: "NO"
```

After you restart Home Assistant then you should have a new sensor called `sensor.team_tracker` in your system.

You can overide the sensor default name (`sensor.team_tracker`) to one of your choosing by setting the `name` option:

```
- platform: teamtracker
  league_id: "NFL"
  team_id: "NO"
  name: "Saints"
```

Using the configuration example above the sensor will then be called "sensor.saints".

To set a Conference ID for an NCAA football or basketball team, use the following:

```
  - platform: teamtracker
    league_id: "NCAAF"
    team_id: "BGSU"
    conference_id: 15
    name: "Falcons"
```

To set up a Custom API Configuration, set the league_id to 'XXX' and enter the desired values for sport_path and league_path.
```
- platform: teamtracker
  league_id: "XXX"
  team_id: "OSU"
  sport_path: "volleyball"
  league_path: "womens-college-volleyball"
  name: "Buckeyes_VB"
```

To override the API language to Spanish, set the api_lang to 'esp'.
```
- platform: teamtracker
  league_id: "NFL"
  team_id: "NO"
  name: "Saints"
  api_language: esp
```

## Sensor Data

### State
The sensor is pretty simple: the main state is `PRE`, `IN`, `POST`, `BYE` or `NOT_FOUND`, but there are attributes for pretty much all aspects of the game, when available. State definitions are as you'd expect:
- `PRE`: The game is in pre-game state. This happens when ESPN publishes the pre-game info via their API.  The lead time varies based on the league.
- `IN`: The game is in progress.
- `POST`: The game has completed. 
- `BYE`: Your given team has a bye week this week. Note that attributes available are limited in this case (only abreviation, name, logo, and last updated time will be available). 
- `NOT_FOUND`: There is no game found for your team, nor is there a bye. This can happen if an invalid league or team ID has been entered.  It can also happen at the end of the season or mid-season when ESPN hasn't published the pre-game info for the next game.  See the [Wiki for help in troubleshooting tips](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker/wiki/Troubleshooting:--State-=--NOT_FOUND) when you believe the sensor is incorrectly in the `NOT_FOUND` state.

### Attributes
The attributes available will change based on the sensor's state, a small number are always available (league, team abbreviation, team name, and logo), but otherwise the attributes only populate when in the current state. The table below lists which attributes are available in which states. 

Some attributes are only available for certain sports.
